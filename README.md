# Introduction to Computer Science in Python

This repository contains code examples learned from an introductory computer science class focusing on Python programming.

The examples cover fundamental concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, file handling, exception handling, as well as usage of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Turtle graphics.

These code examples serve as a testament to my learning journey and the skills acquired during the course. They showcase my understanding of Python programming fundamentals and my ability to apply them in various scenarios. Additionally, they demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing external libraries for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and creative exploration through Turtle graphics.

I'm proud of the work I've done and excited to share it with the GitHub community. These examples not only reflect my progress as a student but also serve as a valuable resource for others interested in learning Python programming or exploring these specific concepts and libraries.

Special thanks to Dr. Katherine St. John for their guidance and support throughout the course.
